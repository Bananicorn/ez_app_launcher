# ez_app_launcher

A simple app launcher for the X window system written in lua.
Based on the X11 bindings by William Adams, which can be found here:

##To Do:

-Add controller support (this is intended for use with a linux system fitted for emulators)
-scale up the fonts
-make window background transparent
-make launcher somewhat styleable through the config file
-add support for icons (read their location from .desktop files)
